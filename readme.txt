The Floorplan is an easy-to-use plugin for WordPress that allows administrators to add a main floorplan image along with pictures of individual rooms. When added to your WordPress site it will appear to your users as an interactive floorplan wherein they can click on rooms to see larger pictures.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This plugin is stable ? =
When version 1.0.0 is released, yes!

= How do I edit/remove images for rooms on a floorplan? =
Changing floorplan images is actually very simple. When you are editing your floorplan - just click the icon for the room you want to edit to open the image in a lightbox. You will see two icons to the left of the lightbox to edit or delete the room.

= Can I hide the camera icon from my users? =
Absolutely. When editing a floorplan just check the box labeled "Don't show camera's on website".

= How do I create a main floorplan image? =
Well, the main floorplan image is something you'll need to create on your own. The Floorplan plugin is intended to allow you to add images of your rooms after you've already made a main floorplan image.

= Can I change the style of the lightbox on the floorplan? =
Right now we have one option for the lightbox, but we are always looking to make our plugins even better. We just need to have enough people request a certain feature before it's added. 

= Is the floorplan responsive? =
We can't make the floorplan responsive because of the way it works

= Can I re-size the main floorplan image? =
The floorplan plugin currently supports one size. We chose this size to accommodate screens of all sizes, but if you want to have the feature added to re-size the main floorplan image you can always bring it up in our Ideas Forum.
